## Project Overview

<p>In this project, we are interested in exploring LLM's capability in finance analysis through its advanced natural language processing capabilities. More specifically, we would like to leverage LLM in the following context. </p>

>Regulatory Compliance: <br>
We hope LLMs can help us stay updated on regulatory changes and help financial institutions ensure compliance with their capability in processing and interpreting complex regulatory documents. This helps ensure our financial practices align with the latest legal requirements. This reduces the risk of non-compliance and associated penalties.

>Data Extraction, Summarization and Automated Report Generation:<br>
We hope LLMs can help us efficiently process vast amounts of financial data, extracting key information from reports and statements.  At the same time, help us generate concise and informative summaries, making it easier for analysts to grasp the essential insights without going through extensive documents. Furthermore, with relevant data extracted, we wish LMM can help draft comprehensive reports, saving time for analysts and ensuring consistency in reporting formats. This allows finance professionals to focus on higher-level analysis and decision-making.
